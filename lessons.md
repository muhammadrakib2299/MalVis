# MalVis — Lessons learned

A running log of decisions, surprises, and lessons captured during the build. Each entry is dated and tied to a commit. Future-me reads this when picking the project up after a break, and reviewers/admissions readers see how the work actually unfolded — not just the polished end state.

## How to use this file

- One section per build step.
- Lead with the **decision** or **lesson**, then a short **why**.
- Note any pitfall worth warning a future contributor about.
- Keep it honest — this is a learning artifact, not marketing copy.

## Step 1 — Repo bootstrap

**Date:** 2026-05-05

**What landed**
- `lessons.md` (this file)
- `.gitignore` covering Python, Node, model artifacts, `.env`, datasets, OS noise
- `pyproject.toml` with ruff + black configured (single source of truth, no duplicate config)
- Folder skeleton matching the README's "Project structure" diagram
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1)

**Decisions**
- **Single `pyproject.toml` over `setup.cfg` + `requirements.txt`.** Ruff and black both read pyproject natively; one config file is one less thing to drift out of sync. `requirements.txt` stays for now because Docker layer caching is simpler than `pip install -e .`.
- **Models are gitignored from day one.** `artifacts/` exists in tree but contents are excluded. Pickles will be too large and arguably sensitive; they ship via release assets or a separate model-registry path, not git.
- **`.env*` excluded except `.env.example`.** Standard pattern but worth being explicit — secrets in git is a dragon we never want to fight.

**Lesson**
- The skeleton is dull but it's the most important commit in the repo. Every later phase assumes these paths exist and these conventions hold. Get it right once.

## Step 2 — FastAPI shell with `/health`

**Date:** 2026-05-05

**What landed**
- `backend/requirements.txt` with pinned versions across the whole ML + web stack
- `backend/app/config.py` — `pydantic-settings` based config, frozen at import via `lru_cache`
- `backend/app/main.py` — FastAPI app, `/health` liveness probe only (intentionally cheap)
- `backend/Dockerfile` — multi-stage, non-root user (UID 10001), `libgomp1` only at runtime, healthcheck baked in
- `backend/.dockerignore` keeping the build context tight
- `backend/tests/test_health.py` — first pytest, uses `TestClient` (no real network)

**Decisions**
- **`pydantic-settings` over `os.getenv` everywhere.** Type-safe, validates at startup, and `lru_cache` makes "read once" enforceable without globals scattered around.
- **`/health` is intentionally dumb.** No model loads, no DB pings, no disk I/O. Liveness ≠ readiness. A future `/ready` endpoint will gate on the model registry; mixing them now would mean restarts cascade into 503s while models warm up.
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile, runtime stage gets only `libgomp1`.** xgboost wheels need libgomp at import time but nothing else from the build toolchain. Smaller image, smaller attack surface.
- **`--proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips=*` in CMD.** When Cloudflare or Caddy fronts the API, `request.client.host` would otherwise be the proxy's IP, breaking per-IP rate limiting. Worth wiring this in before middleware lands.
- **Pinned exact versions.** Pip-with-hashes mode comes later (see `SECURITY.md`); pinning is the floor.

**Pitfall noticed**
- `httpx` and `pytest` are bundled into `requirements.txt` for now (single-file Docker install). When the image gets big, split into `requirements-dev.txt` and use a separate `--target=test` build stage. Don't do it preemptively.

**Lesson**
- Boring scaffolding pays for itself. `/health` looks trivial, but having it green from day one makes Docker healthchecks, deploy gates, and reverse-proxy upstream checks all "just work" later.

## Step 3 — Security middleware and upload validation

**Date:** 2026-05-05

**What landed**
- `backend/app/security/limiter.py` — slowapi `Limiter` keyed on real client IP (works because uvicorn runs with `--proxy-headers`)
- `backend/app/security/upload.py` — `read_pe_upload`, `assert_pe_magic`, custom `UploadValidationError`
- `backend/app/main.py` extended with: rate-limit middleware, 429 JSON handler, locked-down CORS (allowlist + GET/POST only)
- `backend/tests/test_security.py` covering accept/reject paths for magic-byte and size enforcement

**Decisions**
- **Rate limiting at the application layer, not just the proxy.** Cloudflare is great but won't be in front of every deployment (local dev, self-hosters). slowapi means the contract holds even when the proxy doesn't. Defense in depth.
- **Cheapest checks first in `read_pe_upload`.** Order: declared `Content-Length` → streamed size cap (mid-read break) → magic-byte sniff. A malicious client that lies about Content-Length is caught by the streamed cap, and we never accumulate gigabytes in RAM before deciding "no."
- **Upload bytes never written to disk.** `read_pe_upload` returns `bytes` and the caller is on the hook for not retaining them. Per-request tmpfs is for the sandboxed extractor in Step 4, not the API process.
- **CORS is an explicit allowlist with GET/POST only.** No `*`, no credentials. The OPTIONS preflight gets 600s caching to keep the chatter down.
- **Custom `UploadValidationError`** subclassing `HTTPException` so routers and tests can `except UploadValidationError` cleanly without losing FastAPI's auto-conversion to JSON.

**Pitfall noticed**
- `slowapi` requires `app.state.limiter = limiter` *before* the middleware is added, otherwise the decorator-style limits silently no-op. Wired explicitly and noted here so a future refactor doesn't lose it.

**Lesson**
- Validation order is a security property, not a stylistic choice. Cheapest-check-first means an attacker can't make us do expensive work just by sending garbage. Write that down (right here) so the order isn't accidentally "tidied up" later.
