# MalVis — Lessons learned

A running log of decisions, surprises, and lessons captured during the build. Each entry is dated and tied to a commit. Future-me reads this when picking the project up after a break, and reviewers/admissions readers see how the work actually unfolded — not just the polished end state.

## How to use this file

- One section per build step.
- Lead with the **decision** or **lesson**, then a short **why**.
- Note any pitfall worth warning a future contributor about.
- Keep it honest — this is a learning artifact, not marketing copy.

## Step 1 — Repo bootstrap

**Date:** 2026-05-05

**What landed**
- `lessons.md` (this file)
- `.gitignore` covering Python, Node, model artifacts, `.env`, datasets, OS noise
- `pyproject.toml` with ruff + black configured (single source of truth, no duplicate config)
- Folder skeleton matching the README's "Project structure" diagram
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1)

**Decisions**
- **Single `pyproject.toml` over `setup.cfg` + `requirements.txt`.** Ruff and black both read pyproject natively; one config file is one less thing to drift out of sync. `requirements.txt` stays for now because Docker layer caching is simpler than `pip install -e .`.
- **Models are gitignored from day one.** `artifacts/` exists in tree but contents are excluded. Pickles will be too large and arguably sensitive; they ship via release assets or a separate model-registry path, not git.
- **`.env*` excluded except `.env.example`.** Standard pattern but worth being explicit — secrets in git is a dragon we never want to fight.

**Lesson**
- The skeleton is dull but it's the most important commit in the repo. Every later phase assumes these paths exist and these conventions hold. Get it right once.
